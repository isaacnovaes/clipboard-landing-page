## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Styled Components



### Continued development

I have concluded this challenge so much faster than the [first](https://github.com/isaacnovaes/fylo-dark-theme-landing-page) and [second](https://github.com/isaacnovaes/huddle-landing-page-with-curved-sections) challenges that I even got surprised. Over time, I can see that I have solidified the fundamental knowledge of HTML and CSS. In a few weeks, I will get the summer break from my university. It's gonna be for 3 months, so I will use all this time to deeply study the fundamentals of JavaScript.
